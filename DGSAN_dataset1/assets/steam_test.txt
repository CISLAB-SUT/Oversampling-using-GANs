At first this seemed really cool... BEFORE I downloaded it. THEN after spending an hour or so I found it to be a TOTAL DRM P.O.S.. I mean, you have to frigg'n be ONLINE just to play this thing... WTH?EVERY time you want o "play"/ disassemble/Assemble a gun, the game has to REDOWNLOAD the model... WHY?? SUppose you live where the internet conenction is bad, or your camping and want to goof off after a long days hike on your laptop. NOOOOOO....Even the shooting ranges are limited, cause it's only for one kind fo gun. You can pick the kindof shooting range you want, choose whatever gun you want and start popping off shots. NO. It's whatever they want to give you, and only a SMALL fraction of guns get to be used in the shooting range.The game is constanly telling you how much more EXP you could have earned by buying a booster pack, and even forking out $40 doesn't unlock every item (good thing I only got the free version.)Disassembly is dumbed down too. Oh sure, some models require you to remove every screw, but, ONLY for that region. Even then most guns assemble+disassemble as an assembly, meaning a group of parts com apart at the simple click of a button. I really don't feel like you learn much.Textures range from realisic, to flat out lazy. The AK and 1911 are very pretty, but guns like the Tech 9 sport few convincing textures (especially the barrel assembly.) The game goes so far as to tell you you can unlock any gun at any time... IF YOU PAY MONEY....While the multiple X-Ray modes, attchments are cool, there's really nothing redeeming about this at all. If I were to actually get a copy that didn't require the internet to even use and still required money to buy, I'd might consider it. But inthe end, it's really a Modern-day corrupt app. And I don't are if the Devs say: "Well, we want to preven piracy." To heck with that noise, this exact philosophy is what made sooooooooooo many gamers ticked off about the original features of the X-Box 1. So... Why bother with games like that at all. I don't care if this is more of a simulator than a game, I care about integrity, and I find this game to stink to high noon with questionable business practices.------------- REAL GAMERS DON'T NEED THEIR WALLETS TO UNLOCK FEATURES. Nay sayers can go suck a lemon.
Early Access ReviewIve played this game for the past 3 or four builds, the devs ruined it by making the grind unbearable. I dont mind grinding, I actually think that grinding makes some games bearable, for example, my character haas been at the same rank ever since i was ninety hours into the game. Another thing,  ive been losing money just for using a weapon the way it was designed to be used, that is a problem.
If you think that monopoly can be unfun at times multiply that by 30.some of the most unfun game mechanics, including premium currency to undo your dice rolls.don't ever even try to play that for fun with friends
ran like straight dogâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥on my 3 thousand dollar pc. Had to find tutorials to edit *.ini files just to get better performance but still ran like dogâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ i saw almost no players to play with and no one responds in global chat . I waited a couple years for this game so dissapointing. I was hoping it would be a good replacement to Aion, which i quit after 6 years. nope, guess ill keep waiting for pantheon
For â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s sake add the newest update to this damn game.... i spent over 300 dollars and i cant even find a damn multiplayer server just because steam doesnt have version 2.5 yet what the actual â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t "we take care of our customers" yea â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t.... dont waste your time with this they have literally abandoned the project
I started to play War Thunder around october 2016 amd it has several problems wich are not addressed at allSpawnkilling is a huge problem. In the beginning there was no protection at all, you could find enemies beside you or even behind you when you spawned and you have just 20s of invincibility (unless you move forward, then your invincibility is gone).Later the devs tried to fix the issue putting a red stripe along the spawns, when you go inside this red zone you have 30s to exit or otherwise you blew up.But after a few minor patch reduced these red zones to a little circle around the spawn, so you can get spawnkilled again from BEHIND. Maps design doesn't protect you from spawnkill, because in most of the maps your spawn is a in basin.In every match you will find players trying to go to spawnkill instead of trying to capture the objectives. Spawnkill is ongoing since i started playing and Gaijin has failed to address this issue.The community will defend this pratice claiming that it's fair and you should avoid playing when spawnkilling happens and will try to derail thread about people complaining about this problem.Ground battles have a problem with planes spam, you'll get constantly bombed and strafed by low skill players. I'm saying low skill because these are the kind of people who will try to strafe SPAA (self propelled anti aircraft) and there's no skill in dropping a 500/1000 kg bomb on a ground target moving at 20km/h or standing still.You play this so called "ground battle" to see 6 or 7 planes blasting your team with no way to fight back. SPAA are difficult to use especially in RB. In AB is even worse because you can spawn a plane just by making points, then crash on a open tank killing it, without paying repair cost.Bugs in the physic: Shells bouncing on flat surfaces even at close distance or simply not penetrating when they should, buggy hitboxes of the scenery.Sloppy behavior from developers and their community staff, it took them 6 weeks to fix a broken tank and when i complained about it, i was told that it was just a "minor graphic bug" from a steam moderator.Pay to play: every vehicle has a repair cost, plus you'll pay the non-stock ammo. In the beginning the repair cost are low so you won't notice but after you pass BR 5.7 you'll find that the rewards from the battles are the same you get at 3.3 while the repair cost and the ammo cost skyrocket.Without a premium account you simply can't play from 6.3 onward, otherwise you'll get in negative even if you win the match. Just check the repair cost of 6.7/7.0 UK tanks, unless you play a perfect match you'll go in negative, but if you are lucky you can get some reward like 3000 SL.Pay to win: just buy certain premium tanks and your win rate will skyrocket (you can check the win rate of every vehicle here[www.thunderskill.com]). For example, the german t34 have a win rate of 72% while all the other t34 with the 76mm have a win rate less than 50%. Same with the german kv1, kv2 and chuchill.There are several unbalanced premium vehicles at the wrong BR, like the t44-122 at 6.3, while the t44-100 (non premium) is 7.0. Certain premium tanks are somehow invulnerable like the KV220 at 5.7.Now they added a marketplace where you can buy premium camouflage made by other users, so you can hide better just by paying more.Unbalanced matchmaking: no separation between ww2 and cold war in ground forces. It's not acceptable that you have to fight cold war tanks with your ww2 tanks. There's the possibility to have a mixed fight with jets and non-jets, it happened during ww2, but this is a game and it's unbalanced.Too much paper vehicles (projects that were never built) and prototypes, how can you balance a vehicle that never existed or existed in the form of a prototype?Modern tanks like the abrams, the challenger and the 64 wich are still classified, how can you balance a tank with a classified armour?Maps design is terrible, why would someone think that it's a good idea being killed when you just get out from the spawn?Spawns are often in a basin or simply without covers, so enemies have the upper ground while they spawnkill.Maps rotations is broken too, you get to repeat always the same few maps, it's so boring repeating abandoned factory, eastern europe or poland 4 times in a row. Why is so hard to fix?The new graphic engine allows a wide range of weather effects, but you'll only play sunny day with maybe some mist. Night map are even rarerNo change in battle modesTanks have always the same three battle modes: domination, conquest and battle. For the 1.71 they added a new mode called break, it wasn't so good, but it could be developed in something better. Now insted with the 1.77 they simply remove this mode.Planes have seen no change at all in the battle mode, especially in RB where the only mode you play is a semi-deatmatch with always the same 4/5 maps repeating, infact air RB is dying in favor of the plane spam in ground RB, because air RB is simply boring.Too much grind without a premium account: you can see the trailers with modern tanks and jets, but to reach them you need to start from interwar tanks and planes. Without a premium account it will take 2 or 3 years of costantly playing everyday.Do you want to gain enough money to buy your 9.0 tank? You need to play for weeks at 3.3.You need to research and buy even the most basic components for your tank. A stock tank doesn't have repair kits and extinguishers, so don't get hit until your research that repair kits and FPE.Poor comunication from Gaijin: most of the changelog are "Client stability has been improved.", sometimes they add some bugfix. Nerf and buff are written only in major release and not every of them. Poor explanations of new features, people still keep asking, after months of its launch, how the "new" warbond shop works because it isn't properly explained anywhere. Now they launched the marketplace without even announcing it!Poor integration with steam, what's the point of the steam login if you can't log in the forum, marketplace, shop and other relaed service?Reminder that you cannot change your email to avoid the sale of the accounts (like it's difficult to create an email and sell the email account along the war thunder account), but you can create as many fake accounts with temporary email to farm GE (wich is against the rules, but Gaijin doesn't enforce that rule).Marketplace is a new way to milk the players. It adds microtransactions, lootboxes and a new currency called gaijin coins (GJN). Basically is a rip off of the steam market. It allows players to sell skins, decals they made, they get the 30% of the price in GJN, wich naturally can only be spent in the marketplace.You can even buy a p2w tank like the kv220 (btw it's already sold out).No explainations on if and how you can convert GJN in GE or viceversa. 1GJN = 1$, so have fun if the currency of your country is worthless compared to american dollars and euros.Worse than everything, the game allows cheating, you can lower your graphic settings to the infamous ultra low quality, so you can see better through vegetations without being bothered by sunlight, lens flare and other fancy things. You can remove the grass from your aim sight regardless your graphic settings and you can disable the sound of the engine of your tanks so you can hear the enemy better.I would'nt mind if this kind of things are allowed in AB, because you can see the enemy regardless, but in RB and SB ruin everything. If you have to play like this RB/SB are not for you, or simply choose a game that your hardware support.Night map? No problem just change the night in day from postFX settings!Too much smoke? Just lower the particle density!There isn't even a proper anti-cheat, you can only report the suspected cheater.
Early Access ReviewI know I dont have much time played but come on what else is there to do then shoot people. with that said I honestly had fun playing this game. It is very broken in alot of aspects but its early access which HOPEFULLY means its being worked on, right?. I get so used to hearing "early access" that it pisses me off. Early access IS for games that are being actively developed and for some players to get a tase of the action before the full game releases and at the same time the players help the devs by finding glitches, bugs, exploits etc. for the devs to correct. Early access IS NOT an excuse for a broken game..... It IS NOT for a bunch of idiots who dont know what they are doing to release a broken piece ofâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥for people to download and play for 20 mins before getting bored or pisssed which ever comes first... Spawn killing, knifing(broken), unbalanced weapons, modders, framedrops etc. pick your poision, these are a handfull of the many issues this game has. I doubt this game will be fixed.... like EVER. but I wouldn't mind eating my words on that one. until anything big changes my review will stay unchanged.
While the game is interesting in it being an FPS/MMO hybrid filled with an assortment of vehicles and aircraft that many people may enjoy, I found that gameplay to be rather boring and frusturating. Playing it for a couple hours, a common list of observations could be made- Vehicles are extremely advantageous in every aspect of the game- Infantry are limited in there ability to be effective in the majority of the game- Many of the guns appear useless and only a short list of them are really worth spending $$$ on- the spawn areas are usually barraged by tank and infantry fire, making any effort to leave the spawn pointless until the enemy captures- The sections of the map appear similar in design and structure.- Free to PlayI really wanted to like this game because it reminds of an older HL2 mod called Empires with its large battles, except with aircraft! This game can be alot of fun with the right people and I could imagine others really getting into this. Sadly, I feel the core of the game, being the actual shooting part, just wasnt that fun compared to other FPS games.
Early Access ReviewThis game used to be really good...now its a pile ofâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ so much unesessary updates adding in pointless weapons that are broken, removing the tier system with the armour cubes and instead of having level 1-10 of guns they are now called things  like the devistator, levithan, wasp. A year ago it was a simplistic game with lots of potential it had the microtransactions you would expect from any f2p game but it wasnt pay to win, it would simply speed up leveling up so you could get to the point where buying 10 cubes of the next tier up didnt take 5 games. Now its just pay to win and has lost the core consept of the game where you would place the best tier cubes you could get under your piolet seat and guns and use half cubes to channel where damage would go keeping it away from your pilot seat but now it is just how many guns can you put on that you bought with real moneya good game wasted.
Early Access ReviewCurrently running a GTX 1070 SC, 16gigs ram, with an I7 3770S. I have lowered all my settings in game to the lowest possible. Changed my .ini files to lower them even further from what the game allows me too, and I still cannot get frames above 20fps in towns or anywhere with low population. This game is NOT new, this game has been out for several years and has launched in 3 regions. They have had time to improve the performance but they didn't.Do not waste your money
I played this hame before so I decided to redownload it, and this is what happens when I tried to run it.PC crash 1: Your computer has run into a problem. So it restarted.PC crash 2: My entire PC froze and I had to hold the power button to restart it. When it did, I struggled to get my wifi back online.Then a friend of mine tells me the same thing happened to him when he tried to play the steam version of the game, and he says his computer crashed too.I dont know what the problem is, and I really enjoyed the game, but I just know 1 thing. Im never even going to try and launch it again. Id rater not risk it.
If you want to pay money, this game is probably fun.If you don't want to pay money, this game is baloney.The tutorial is terrible, the narrating guidance is annoying, and the battles you're placed in are so OP they're ridiculous.Oh, and every time you lose, you lose game money which took you forever to earn.
Early Access Reviewit game unbalance ex. 1.cause the monter has agais power --> so i can't dostory(spell cards) him. The player 2 can't spell power(+2 +2) to monster agais like me ?? 2.the yellow card is very fast power--> empower max (+2 +2) no unlimits same as the warcry
2000 Gold Eagles to ducktape shrubs to my tank? Thats the last straw for me and it should be for you guys too! Don't support these money sucking Rusian biases anymore until they change thier ways. Gajin can take my credit card and shove it up thier @$$es.Cation, huge wall of text, but contains the truth. also, I apologise for any spelling errors. Thankyou for your time.My Professional Review:   To make this more professional, I have been playing War Thunder for over 3 years. I have ssen they game grow up and add lots of awsome features like ground forces and lots of game engine additions. They also added a lot of additions that are either poor or money grabbing scemes like the vehicle research and xp conversion system. And they battle rating which is and has been one of the biggest problems with the game. you might not think its a problem at low tiers but wait till you get to tier 4 or 5, then you will be ripping your hair out every match epecially if you are a bomber player. If they would just sit down and fix the BR, the game would be 3x more enjoyable and might even help fix some of the Russain and German bias you probably heard so much about. Last, is the Gajin staff and forum moderators. While I give them credit for some of the great work they have done, they completely disregard the community and thier oppinions which is another reason why this game isn't reaching its full potential. The staff always says that if you have any opinions or ideas to make the game better, to go talk about it on the forums. Most of the time they dont read any of the suggestions most of the time unless a post is attracting a lot of attention. If they don't like what the post has to say, they will take it down and ban the author from the forums because I guess they still don't have freedom of speech in Russia. What really irritates me is thier recent actions to the community like thier " Russian Bias Party" joke which while I agree it was kind of funny, was also unproffesional. What really upset me though was thier cash grab with the new tank customization features. After recieving community backlash about charging 500 Golden Eagles for tank customizations and bush camo, which I disagree with at least paying for the bushes. They then stated 2 days later that that was only a special and raised some of the bushes up to 2000 GE. I found this vulgar and unproffesional, Gajin has plenty of money not to do this yet they just keep trying to milk thier money maker of a game. If Gajin wants to keep thier community happy, they need to get thier act together anf if you are still here, welcome to the madhouse and don't pay Gajin a cent until they fix themselfs and the game.
1.37 - What more can I say that hasn't been said a thousand times before...Pre 1.37 - Best flight game around, hands down.Post 1.37 - Absolutely terrible in every way.  All fun remofved and replaced with frustration.Would I recommend?  Right now, hell no, even WoT on it's worst days is better.  If 1.39 actually fixes anything (chiefly MM) then yes, otherwise it's uninstall time...
Early Access ReviewThis was a good game, but now coming back to it after being gone for a while and seeing these terrible new updates. You used to be able to hop into a game and be in the lobby waiting only a few minutes but now having these long wait periods and then not even getting into the queue and then having to wait another four minutes is kinda ridiculous and i get it this game is in alpha but come on.
Product received for freeEarly Access Reviewworse game ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!graphics are great but gameplay is ****edmy pc was hacked and my emailif like trojen hourses please install this.
OMFG...  Worst free game download I've ever suffered.  First I download the game, which takes forever (big deal, I'm used to it).  Then, the game has to download... the game?  Idfk.  Also takes forever and you can't turn off the background music until it's done (maybe include that in the initial settings menu?).  The gameplay tutorial is over simplified and makes me worry for the gameplay itself.  Couldn't even make it that far though.  After the gameplay tutorial comes the painfully convoluted reward system tutorial.  I just wanted to play a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing card game.  Why do we need 50 different ways to obtain 50 different types of rewards?  Gives you options to get this reward and that reward without telling you what any of theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥does.  Just keeps bombarding you with all these little reward system tutorials, one after another.  And in between each one, it does that ridiculous bright flashing light nonsense.  I'm glad I'm not epileptic, but I do have a sensitivity to bright lights.  Have to wear sunglasses just to play.  I'm good on all this nonsense.  I was just feeling nostalgic about the old PSX Yu-Gi-Oh game.  Nostalgia has effectively been neutralized.  I'm WAY over it now.   1.4 hours on record... 1.2 of it was downloading and the rest was just a painful tutorials.  The card game is NOT complicated, why would you make the tutorials THAT complicated?  SMGDH...
Early Access ReviewThe old one, alike to a lot of games, was far better, Although I haven't personally played the new game, i hear they removed seats, tiers, and a lot of the things that made it so good previously, along with the matchmaking which has apparently been drastically unbalanced. TL;DR, Old one was better. 3/10 wouldn't play much again,
Early Access ReviewI used to enjoy this game. For me, the original selling points were:Classes being different, allowing for different kits to be used.Forging and chicken trophies being the only way to get end-match gear.A second chance to come back from death, albeit only in a team setting and only a slight chance.-The first two points were completely destroyed by recent patches, and the chicken speed boost with faster recover time means that their "downed state" is now actually faster than their "fighting state."The only pros left to the game are that it doesn't have building (which I don't feel strongly about either way), and that it is free to play. That being said, there are other FTP options, and I'd suggest checking those out instead. The devs haven't listened to the community, and now their game is dying quickly.
I have hundreds of hours into the orignal game and was confused when I first saw this. First I thought, " Why is a phone game on here? " and " Is it only between PC players or will Phone players be included?" Yes this is a port directly from the moblie game and yes you do play aginest people on said phones. Its very unfair in that respect as PC players are at a extreme advatage. That held up very true. Most battles I could just rush behind or besides enemys and they would die quicly and be confused.  This game should have stayed on iOS and Android and not for PC. It works good there and should have never left.  Wargaming, like most other companies, is just here for cash grap and not listening to anyone in the community. People thought they would make World of Tanks be accessable from Steam but all they did is rerelease a mobile port that really sucks. It dosen't even run right after playing it for less then 3 hours, it crashes after startup everytime. If you see this please just go and download the original game and ignore this. The original World of Tanks is alot bigger, alot more graphicly pleasing and alot more PC optimized.
It's a monopoly-like game, though monopoly mechanics were thrown out the window, and the whole game just comes down to clicking 'ok' after rolling a dice and deciding whether or not to buy a piece of the board. It lacks some crucial features to make you feel like you have a meaningful influence on the outcome of the game. You can't bid when buying, put a mortgage on your cities (you can only sell entire cities, can't even sell single houses), or trade cities with other players so that you both agree on a price, you can just buy them back from others without even asking them. It's pay-to-win in a way that you can choose to roll favourable dice. You can get random disconnects for no reason and then you can't reconnect. Definitely not recommended.
Early Access ReviewAt this current moment, this game isn't worth a dime.  I would strongly suggest you wait till it either goes on sale or eventually goes free to play in a few months.  Optimization isn't a thing, server lag and frame rates are horrible, and the English translations are bad.  I spent most of my six hours of gameplay in queue to play the game only to get access to a screen that told me the "area was too crowded."  This game has potential to be great, just not anytime in the near future.
Though steam only shows that I have 750+ hours you can look up my smite guru account that will show that I have 2500+ hours of in match time in this game. It is hands down the game I have played the most in the last 7 years. It has all the addictive draw of a game like league of legends, champion/god lore. Loot boxes. Pvp. Many uniquie heros/abilites, with almost no long term thought, or short term fixes. This game will hook you, if you are someone like myself. There is a certain level of surface polish, but nothing past that. They add in addition after addition, and never back up any of their promises. They added in clan rewards over 2 years ago, that could be completed in 2 months, then haven't touched on them in years. Many of the games, gods voice packs are still incomplete after an update 3-4 years ago. Higher lvl, none exclusive skins cost around 15 dollar a pop. And exclusive-limited skins are either stuck in gambling chest or behind other limiters that can range for 45 dollars to 100+.You can, of course play without skins, so that isn't a massive drawback. But gods, relivancey is tied to their skin releases in some cases. Some gods recieve an uncalled for buff, and next week, a new skin comes out. Thinking that players will now buy it because said god is now in the meta. The game is rampant with bugs/crashes but they choose to focus on skins, jump stamps, and other flavor things instead of the things that will illeviate some of the rage that this game induces. I would happily pay money for this game to not release a new god, or skin for 6 months. If they solely focused of issues causing errors, reconnection issues, bugs, UI, balance, optimization etc.From someone who has a very love hate relationship with this game. The players can be "toxic" as in much other mobas, but there is no love in care here from delevopers. Watch one of their cringe inducing patch note shows, there is a thin veiled facade, they are trying to sell you skins and gods. And that this where their focus lies. I understand, it's a bussiness. But I would be happy supporting a bussiness that is focus 1st on a good player experience and second on selling me skins.  As apposed to the other way around. HiRez is a small company is comparison to most, and due to their choices ( and miniscule lack of marketing [rivialing most stupid mobile phone games with facebook banner ads]) they will stay this way, and SMITE like all other of their properties will die out within the next 5 years. TLDR: If you are looking for a 3D moba play it. Don't invest your money in skins, cause the game won't be long lasting. If you are fine dropping money on the god back, that is fine. You'll have fun. But grow frustrated with this companies focus if you pay attention to where they spend their resorces.
Early Access ReviewId give a positive review but the game for Australian players has became impossible to play with 200 odd ping connecting to ASAIN servers. id rather wait the 3mins then play with that sorta ping.
Never actually got to play this game.Once started, it has to download (at this point in time) 394 packages of something, which I left my computer on overnight to finish. Watched it finish maybe an hour after I looked at it in the morning then tryed to sign in.It began downloading those 394 packages again.Seems to me like a huge waste of time.9.9 hours in game, haven't played a single minute.
Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.It's more like a player survival not zombie.
Came back after a year hiatus because there was a long list of issues I had with the game, everyone knows about the extraordinary long grinding time, which, fine its free to play, what more do you want? Wargaming's own research model isn't NEARLY as punitive for free to play players from how it feels. I don't play world of tanks, just warships, so I could be wrong on that factor 100%. Enough beating the horse. War Thunder's new matchmaking method still sucks. In fact I would go as far as to say it had gotten worse. It only seems to serve as a way to stack lower tiered players against higher tiered players (on both sides gotta get that two way action of frustration going) in order toâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥off the lower tier players into coughing up cash to tier up only to find they get matched with vehicles of a still higher tier and the cycle only ends if you cough up that dosh to tier 5 where all you have to do is worry about players like myself that suffered up to the tier 5 grind. This seems to be more of a problem for armor than it does aviation where a bit more skill appears to be involved if you are outmatched against a better performing fighter. Unless you are prepared for the level of frustration that comes before you, its best to pick a game you will actually enjoy instead of grinding frustration simulator designed to try and coerce money out of your wallet. If you don't take this seriously, the Encyclopedia Dramatica article concerning it will in fact point you in the direct of a more humerous and shockingly true overview. Don't believe me still? Play the game then re-read the article and you will smack yourself on the forehead.4/7/2018The game kept starting the launcher for something I thought I uninstalled, turns out if you use steam, it will delete the files used to install via steam, but everything that the launcher installed stays in a folder that was 17 GB and continued to keep launching the launcher whenver I logged into my computer, unchecked the "auto-start" option, which didn't work, deleted the registry for startup via CCleaner which didnt work and would reassign itself to launch at the start of logging in, so I deleted the whole folder which solves the problem. As it would turn out, this is a result of lazy developers producing rootkit tier programming. I still dont reccomend the game, this sore spot aside, due to apperent imbalances with maps that they know have problems.
This game looks like fun, if I could ever get it to work! Constantly dealing with the game telling me I have no activated account when I have registered and still ended up with nothing. 
Early Access Reviewthe game use to be awesome but look now ITS A TRASH they redid the whole game gave us back the tech tree and take back the homming missiles the campers are all over the game now is use to be one spipers or skilled bommers but now everyone camp like WTF
Early Access ReviewWhere should i start... Well this game seem to be a knock off verison of CS-GO... It doesn't run smooth its a little laggy for the most part. It is just plan out the most dumbest game i ever played... Only best thing about this game is the Uninstall feature... DON'T GET THIS GAME AT ALL!!!
This game is a POS. Features are rediculous and stupid, UI is weird, graphics look like poop, the rocks in the game look like  piles of brown potatos. Even in a beginners server you get wrecked by higher level players, then you get kicked, lose all your stuff and then once your player finishes with their cool down timer, you can spawn in again but you have nothing. It's really easy to find stuff in the game. really easy but why. whats the point. also its a map of vast emptiness. it's your running sim. The zombies were just randomly placed, they do nothing but just stand in once spot and make noises. maybe you will find a couple that walk in the same pattern over and over agian. this game was put together so poorly. don't waste the hour it takes to downlaod and the hour it takes to figure out its just a POS.Just saw this. "Our beginner servers offers our new players to learn the game, facing players with less than 1 hour playtime." in game it says with less than 12 hours. WTF, the developer cant even get their own game straight.
I highly recommend against downloading this game. First off, it's microtransaction hell, you have to pay for everything. The game is also pay to win, bad. Whenever you die, you either have to wait a certain amount of time or pay to respawn. The game is very buggy and broken, I've been killed by zombies before I even spawned in and they wanted me to pay to respawn. The damage registry is pathetic, I've had several times where I'd shoot a player in the head multiple times and they'd walk away. Also, the cars are extremely broken and laggy, someone can get in a car and lag all over the map running everyone over for free. The player movement is terrible, the characters are extremely slow and stamina runs out extremely fast. It's free to play so it's obviously not going to be great but even on F2P games, this is bottom tier.
This game created a new concept, Free to play-> Pay to Play-> Pay some more to be able to enjoy it -> Pay some more again to win -> skip all previous steps and delete game. Period.This game could be great if the developers could figure out if they want to make a premium game or a free to play game. Choose one, it is not that hard.
Played it for a while, had fun until i got the max level. Then, i wanted to try out the other classes, but they had to be payed for so i quit. I then came back to see if anything had changed, but then i found out that you now had to pay to recieve the new levels, and the cheapest pack was 15 pounds. Complete destruction of a game by developers wanting more money.
Early Access Reviewi Truly am saddened by this games launch to pay 40 dollars for a founders pack that was made useless by the devs decisions is silly let me tell you my story so far. so bless launches yesterday the 28th I bought the game at around 3:00 EST I buy and download the game because there has been a lot of hype and although I know launches can be rocky i was not ready for what was going to unfold i download the game and its a pretty quick download an hour or so and launch it for the first time it opens a launcher and i can't play the servers are down for maintenance and im just stuck so after waiting for about 30 min i was told to restart steam because they pushed an update so i did. the update downloaded and i launched the game and pressed play it launched in an odd resolution and was very small so i closed it and tried to change it in the launcher settings only to find there is no 1920x1080p resolution so i put it on the highest it could go (720p) and relaunched only to get stuck on the bless splash screen for a while i relaunched the game over 7 times until it finally decided to let me in. i got in and was prompted to make a character and that was probably the nicest part about my experience was there were a lot of options for character creation reminds me of black desert character creation bit i digress.I created my Character and hopped into the game for the first time i was in the tutorial and got around 15fps the first npc i talked to had a very poor english translation it was wonky at best that's when i got to the combat system (i chose to be a paladin) my main attack was not left click it was 1 R R R this is not an action type combat system it was not fast pace it was slow and clunky then before i had a chance to mess with the skill tree i was disconnected from the server because it crashed as i reloaded my game and got past the Buggy splash screen i was greeted with a full server with a queue of over 4000 players it took me hours to get in th top 600 and as i was approaching 100 i got booted to 500 again and again till the server went down again. Thats when i stopped playing and decided to wait till this morning the 29th and  getting in was better but as i got in the fps was so bad i had to wait 5 ish min for things to render on my screen keep in mind im on a 50mb connection and i have a gtx 1060 6gb so not a potato by far then once it rendered i was averaging about 20-24 fps i did the first quest of dropping the dead body and went afk for 5 min and came back to a disconnected screen server crash again i didnt claim my rewards as a founder after i had found out if you for example claim them on a character on server 1 and dont want to be that character you lose all founder items on your new character and if god forbid you delete that character you lost all founder stuff forever
Early Access ReviewA year and a half ago and I would of thoroughly recommended this game. But after recent updates my opinions towards this game have changed drastically. With an almost entirely new combat system now allowing bots to have more than one weapon type which completely breaks the nature of the game. I like the idea of free loot etc after a game to ease the process of getting items for your bot however the removal of the tech tree with the tier stars was a bump downhill and really where my dislike for the game happened. I could go on for much longer but I fear I would bore those of you reading this review so I will put it nice and clear at the end here for you.DON'T PLAY THE GAME THEY TURNED IT INTO A LOAD OFâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
It Cucked me from the start because I am a black man and dont have alot of money, this game is racist it would only land me on other players properties because I am a young black male
Early Access ReviewI wish I could write a fair review on the gameplay, but I couldn't even make it past the starting area. This game performs as well as a football bat and the translations are even worse. I tried every online suggestion and could barely break 60fps without stuttering and screen tearing. The antequated DX9 really shows it's age.
Meh...It's somewhat fun.  Here's my issue:  The game kinda boot-to-the-neck grinds your face.  The tutorial I get...do this, okay now do this.  But after the tutorial, the game still doesn't let you really play to your liking.  It still tells you what you  can do next, which is only ever one option.  Basically, most of the game is click next to continue, and that button moves.  Then you get to battle, yay, then go back to click next to continue.  What's that? You wanted to buy more consumables to help you? Nah, you gotta buy a tank from another country now.  But I wanna upgrade my gun!  Tough, now sell that important thing you probably will need.  But I wanted that, here, let me buy one back from the shop...nah, time for battle!â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game.  If I wanted a comic about tanks/video games, I'da downloaded that.
Two days in a row this game has killed my internet connection when it was 'contacting' it server. Had to reset my router to get my conncetion back.Won't be playing this again.oh and yeah it is pretty much pay to win and definatly not worth the entrace fee
Well, this game used to be very fun and very interesting.  However, the recent changes to the economy, including the tier/research revamp, have caused the people I play with and myself to stagnate horribly.  Now, I feel like I am not getting any closer to a high-tier fighter.  That is because I am not.  On average, I have received about 500 points towards a new plane, which costs about 120,000.  That's about half a percentage.  Granted, before the XP system was flawed similarly, but you unlocked every plane for a level once you leveled up, and there were times when I got 10,000-20,000 XP, so now I have to play approximately 4 times as many games to unlock just ONE PLANE.  Not to mention, I then have to pay for it with lions, the game's currency.  So, while the early tiers seem to be pretty much the same, more or less, after about tier 3 the game becomes an unbearable grind.  So, if you feel like grinding for hundreds of hours, feel free, and obviously there are casual options.  However, I would suggest purchasing premium/eagles or waiting until they fix the economy.
Early Access ReviewI do not recommend this game... yet, it needs patches, updates and improvements. the combat system is basicallyâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and also, you get all the skills at the beginning of the game already, so you have nothing to play for but armor and weapons. This game has potential, but it is not good yet.Please improve the combat system and add more abilities/skills to unlock throughout the game.
Early Access ReviewI was one of those people giving them a pass on launch day.  But the communication and optimization is a joke.First 15hours of my play time was looking at a bless loading screen. sucking the motation to play out out of you.  The early game skill instruction is almost non existant. The LAG. The stutter and lag spikes  are a mood killer.  Item Dupe on day 2 is almost LOL worthy, but Im too irrtated to do so. Ive never refunded a game.  Im sure as hell starting here.Edit: I want to add, that when I COULD play, I did enjoy. If this game goes F2P,  and smooths out its framerate, and bugs, Id try it again.
Early Access ReviewDont play this game. If you dont want cancer dont play this game. If you dont want to pull a Kurt Cobain...DONT....PLAY...THIS...GAME.This game suffersâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥internet capabillities and horrid hit detection aswell as hitboxes. You have a better chance at trying to fit yourâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in a cherrio then trying to hit somebody in this game.And again and I repeat just to prevent your untimely demise... DONT PLAY THIS GAME.
Smite is a decent game in its own right. Its just let down by a multitude of game breaking bugs and a toxic player base to boot.if your a new player then be warned, others on your team will blame you if you lose. If you can't do anything the way they want, be prepared for the immense amount of toxic trash talk headed your way. Also the matchmaking is broke as well. When i first got the game i was matched with other players that had put 1000 hours into the game. But on the bright side, the game is truly free to play. They're no pay to win aspects at all. You only have to pay for cosmetics like skins and ward skins. There is a diverse selection of gods to pick from so its garunteed to have a god that suits your play style. The game is constantly being updated to fix bugs and add new gods to the roster. Like i said the game is decent but its let down 100% by its toxic player base cause after all, if you die in the game you die for real apparently.
i played this game when it was in beta and to be comletely honest the beta was sooooo much better it wasnt to hard to earn money and barely any pay to players oh and dont get me stared with hackers overall if the devs fixed things insted of adding it would be a much better game.
This game is a Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥ing joke. This is not random, this is just laughing at player's face. You can't do anything, you don't have a chance to even show some skills. This game is just Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥ing you so hard that you don't even have fun playing with your friends. Just buy normal monopoly, some beer, pizza and meet your friends, cause games like thisÃ¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥are taking your life away.In Polish: jaÃ¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥co zaÃ¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥..
This game is fun... for a while. Then it devolves into a massive rage enducing s**t storm.I'll give the game credit where it's due. It looks very nice and it's more realistic compared to WoT.Sadly, the match making in this game is horrible. When you start out, the most you have to worry about is making sure you don't die and everyone is pretty much on the same level. The MOMENT you research a Tier 2 Tank/Plane however, it throws you in the deep end and puts you up against people who have unlocked Tier 4 and 5 Tanks/Planes, of which the Tanks can one shot anything ranked below them, and the Aircraft battles feel like you're a grunt going up against Team Starfox (and no amount of barrel rolls will save you).Plus, whenever you get a new Tank, it's a load of garbage, and the only way you can research the parts needed to make it better is to take it into battle, which means you're playing at a disadvantage till it's fully upgraded, and, usually, by the time that happens, you've researched a new (and probably better) tank to replace it.It's a shame it had to end this way, as I was really enjoying myself and felt like I was getting somewhere, but the minute the bulls**t hit the fan and the rage enducing Tier 5 Tank one shots started happening, I dropped this thing like a bomber payload, without the satifying explosion.
Early Access ReviewIm in a middle of a competitive game and all of a sudden out of nowhere this games launcher opens up right in the middle of a game, like why. its a stupid game anywaw just take it off of the store
This game may slowly eat away at your humanity, stay away and stick to Bot matches if you wanna remain untainted. However, if you are able to look past the toxic community and somewhat flawed matchmaking (in either high or low priority), it is otherwise a pretty fun game.
Would be easy enough to recommend for casual action RPG fans if it wasn't full of the usual MMO malarkey of getting you to fork over money for every little thing... so naw, stay away, don't bother.Game is cute but the gameplay is... tried and true would be the most cherisable way to describe... but really it gets boring pretty fast.
One of the worst communities in the world. There's nothing wrong with the game itself, but it is a multiplayer game and it's a failed experiment. Getting into ranked games is literally cancer. Someone doesn't lock in, game will start and someone will disconnect. Everyone will false report literally anyone. It's literally just a tumor on this earth and I can't stop playing. Save your soul and pass this up.
hello my name is pat and i want to give you a short comparison between blitz and the normal world of tanks( and sorry if my english is bad its my second language )blitz :Pros, -small file size and easy to understand-fast pasted combat that is arcade likeCons, -absolute 0 Depth-you cant change factions from the start-graphics comparable with mario 64-really bad pay to win- it plays and feels like TankiOnline -it has no arty world of tanks :Pros,-amazing graphics -easy to understand but hard to master-a really deep garage where you can customise (almost) everything while still keeping the look easy to understand-more gamemodes-frequent updatesCons,big file size (16 - 30 GB depending of the graphical settings)some graphical settings might be too mutch for the low end computersalso pay to winConclusion :If you like blitz you might aswell play Tankionline and Dear devs please leave blitz to the mobile and put the normal Wot (world of tanks) here !
Ok, I've seen enough. Let me start from the beginning. I really wanted to like this game. I've been reading about it way before premiere. I was hoping for something trully fresh and mindblowing. Instead of that, we've got... this trash.I know I've spent only couple of hours playing, but if game don't want me to try its content then I uninstall it.PERFORMANCE ISSUES. It's one, big lagfest. It may be ok somewhere when no one else is, but then try to visit some locations with other players (not to mention bigger cities). Game runs terribly and it's not a fault of my pc. Other (even newest) mmos run smoothly.I've got stuck three times (inside wall, floor, stone) and each time I had to use recall stone, and run all the way over to the place were I got stuck. Once I fell over the map. I could watch freefall of my character as textures went up to the sky.QUEST & EXPING. There's almost no exp for killing monsters so it's better to leave them alone and just run from one quest to another. I could understand that if the quests were fun. Oh my god they are not... Run couple of minutes from one npc to some place, do something for 3 seconds and run again to the same/another npc. So if quests are mostly running and killing monsters make no sense, what else can I do? I've heard about dungeons but I don't have enough patientce to level up anymore.COMBAT. This is another issue for me. Maybe not for everyone, maybe it's just me. Unfortunately combat is one of the worst I've seen in a while. Boring, unintuitive and simply not fun. But whats the reason in making it fun if You don't even want to kill any mobs, right? POSITIVES. I really liked character creation. Plenty of races and classes. A lot of different options of body shapes, faces, hairstyles, colors etc. All that You need to create Your unique avatar.Graphic are also pretty decent. I stopped couple of times just to watch something but You can see that game engine has couple of years. It does not explain why my computer has so much trouble with fps. I will say it again. I really, REALLY wanted to like this game. I've waited before buying it and I'm glad that I din't spend any money on it. I finally tried it on free to play and after 3-3,5 hours it getting out of my disc. Seriously, try anything else. Maybe there're not a lot of new titles but this one is simply not worth it.Not to mention best mmos (like WoW, GW2, FFXIV, ESO etc.) or even this average (Neverwinter, Aion, Archeage etc.), it's even better for You to try something like "Riders of Icarus" or "Revelation Online" then something like Bless.PS. I totallt forgot about one annoying thing. Game chat. Oooo man, mostly russian alphabet, dumb people spaming some dumb things and from time to time something normall. As it always is in crappy f2p games.
Early Access ReviewEnd game is 1 dungeon, no objective based pvp, no raids.Im sure it will all come eventually but level grind should take a decent player 3-4days a more casual player probably a week.If a content update doesn't come out by the time you are 45 for longer than 7days you will prolly quit this game to.PvP balance is terrible, mages 3-4 shotting people without even using combo skills. Tank can 1 combo people.I wanted to give this game a chance but honestly I'm not paying 40 bucks for a game I'm gonna play for 20 hours then have to wait who knows how long for an update maybe even multiple updates to make it even close to remotely enjoyable as an everyday game.Sadly though my refund was denied, and I have never refunded a game on steam or any game in general ever so if that doesn't go to show you how low I think of this early access goodluck trying it yourself.
Before the release of Update 1.37, I would have recommended this game to anyone. There were a few issues that still needed to be ironed out with matchmaking and flight models, but the game was great and had a lot of potential. However, after the release of Update 1.37 I would recommend that players avoid the game until Gaijin figures out how capitalism works.
Early Access ReviewThis game is simply childish. There's not much to do. This game has potential, but it's wasted. If you liked the mechanics though, Everquest has the same mechanics.
Waited for this game for 6 years since it was first previewed and couldn't wait for it.  Tried it in Russia, Korean Rebuild, and Japan.  All of these versions were better despite the optimization issues and slow combat (Japanese version was actually ok in the combat, just needed a slight increase in speed).  Then came the NA version.  Cheats were everywhere and dupes still existed from previous versions/regions that were known about for years.  Optimization was still never fixed.  Cheaters/dupers received slaps on the wrist.  Absurd gear time releases made the factions imbalanced quickly.  Server merges made it even worse despite the company knowing that it would be this way.The people representing the company in the discord were terrible (childish, dismissive to legitimate complaints about not only the game but other staff members, rules not enforced ie person would be kicked after 5 minutes of voicing concern over the game yet someone with a racist slur in their name was brought up to every single staff member and it took 5 hours before someone would do anything about it after bringing it up a second time).  Overall a terrible experience in game and interaction with the company in the discord.  I had minor issues with optimization, but dealt with it for awhile.  Finally decided that they weren't going to fix any legitimate complaints and that this version was going to suffer the same fate as all of the other regions: any new version that came out would get the spotlight and the previous ones would be forgotten about.  This version is about to get the same treatment because of the xbox1 version that's in the works.
I'm happy to pay $15/mo for an "all-access" pass. I'm fine with spending up to $10 on a single cosmetic. I'm not forced to pay these costs, and I'm completely okay with giving some money to any developer that I think deserves it.However, the new implant system (which is actually over a year old at the time of writing this) is disgusting pay-to-win and forces players to cough up cash in exchange for actual advantages in combat. Whilst the system isn't necessarily p2w on its own, in the context of the game you're more or less forced to choose between unlocking new weapons, attachments, etc (which are already a grind) or spending your certs on implant packs for those advantages.The price of upgrading implants is a joke, but having to roll a bunch of loot boxes for the chance at an "exceptional" implant is like salt in the wound... not that Daybreak care though - H1Z1 is dying and any moves they make are unlikely to be little more than cash grabs before they finally close everything up.Frankly, it's sad. I'll try to remember Planetside 2 for what it was and not what it became. Sure, it was always a grind, but at least it didn't punish players for not handing over their wallets. I can no longer support this company.
I have been on Warthunder on and off. And it's constantly the same thing, 1 Nation is OP as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and all the others keep getting nerfed. Please, either fix the balancing matches for skill level (Tired of sh*t teammates screwing up the game), balance nations or just put the ACTUAL HISTORICAL values. Until then, beatings will continue until morale improves on my end, and I will play once again, once the game is "stable".
Early Access ReviewSteam needs better quality control/  alot of the games i've tried or download for free dont wroks well. its not a slow pc issue or internet connectivity, thjey are just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 2nd rate games.  get rid of this crap. .  this game is one of them.  works hardly and its always begging for money.  amatuerish at best!  GET LOST!
A couple weeks ago i bought a gewehr with sniper scope and i was killing everyone until i rank up and found someone with way more high level gun which almost impossible to obtain unless you buy it. 6/9 P2P games
Sometimes (a lot of time) you just get screwed by bad RNG draws. You get stuck at 2 to 3 power while your opponent draws just what they need. Or you draw 5 or 6 power cards in a row screwing you over.It's simply not fun to play when you have no control over if you draw enough power cards to play your other cards. 
The game gives you missions, if you complete them you will get currency called gm..If you are asking what can you do with gm..Just nothing(buy only cosumebles) but every thing else is for em...Which you can get by spending money in the game...dont do that
While this game may be fun in the beginning after putting 300 hours in I can offically say that this is the first game in my life that I hate every moment of playing. This game is what cancer actually feels like. Gaijin doesnt care about anything either as they havent fixed a single thing yet continue to add broken tanks into the game and pat themselves on the back for it.  Would rather eat glass than play/ 10
The game as it is is pretty good. I would recommend it but unfortunately the publisher / dev is doing so much to prevent this game from being decent. Events are just tedious, mind numbing grinding. A recent event required you to do over 100 Games within 3 days to get a tank OR plane. or you could go ahead and buy it from their new market for 40 bucks. Ground Forces (tanks) is even more grinding than air forces. it will take you weeks until you have a solid line up in a nation. or you could just go ahead and buy exp with real money. The Ground Forces grind is even worse for modifications for each tank. For example: you have to research fire extinguishers. That can take a decent amount of games. especially not having fire extinguishers means that one hit can lit you up and it will burn down your tank. while you watch. being unable to do anything. or well, you could just go ahead and research mods like these for real money You have to train your crew. Not so bad for planes since you have only one crewmember for most fighters but in tanks you have up to 6 (?) crew members in tanks. You have to train every single one of them individually. or you spend some bucks on them. Air RB battles are unchanged since the game came out. They are unbalanced not fun and grinding sucks. You often come out with just as much SL (in game currency to buy stuff) as before since some planes have extremely high repair costs Their balancing methods are just bad. Instead of incrementally nerfing or buffing a tank every other week, they will completly nerf a tank down after months and will do nothing about said tank (or plane for that matter) for months again.  Naval forces have been in closed access (meaning you have to pay to play them) for over a year now In the steam screenshots you can see u-boats. There are no u-boats in the game. They only have been in the game for one day (april fools)The list goes on. That's just what I have in my mind right now. You can take a look at more posts like these:/r/warthunder General Rant/r/warthunder about Repair Costs/r/warthunder about their horrible PR/r/warthunder about Repair Costs II  
started game, spawned near nothing, found airplane, kicked zombiesâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥by punches in face, found a bat and a gun with 10 bullets.. suddenly it's night and i'mma attacked by 3 or 4 zombies in the middle of other zombies with no more bullets in my gun pressing '3' to take my bat and smash some zombie heads but nothing, my guy is really scared, i guess,  not willing to change the weapon and stick with the gun with no bullets.. dead for 10 mins??? (character actually can't get in the game for 10 mins, u must create another survivor..) .. but i'll use that time for disinstall..
Early Access Reviewi didnt end up playing the game that much. nohing against it in that wat. when i went to uninstall it the game tried to re-download its files before the uninstall finished. luckily, firewall stopped it and let me know. its not ok for programs to do this
so where do I begin, I played this game wayyy back before this game was even "released" onto steam. When I played, it still had a Beta tag at the top right corner. Ahh the memories, anyone remember that? The Beta tag I mean? Reason why I bring this up is because, the game was actually GOOD when it was still in beta. Gave the game some sort of a excuse for slight mistakes. But now that it has been released, that excuse doesn't work anymore. The game was a lot more fun and simple before Squad 2.0 and everything after that. I quit the game maybe a year after the release of Squad 2.0 because of the lack of new content. Because of how long I have played the game, I felt the urge to come back to see if any thing had been added or changed. To my surprise...................... very little changed. Tanks are now much harder to kill, which I have conflicting feelings about cause I loved playing my tanker. And 1 map was added. ONE........ COME ON RETO!!!! I played a few matches on that new map (in regular MM, too lazy to even play War anymore), ended up carrying the team as per usual and then I once again, unistall. A few weeks later, the new update comes out and turns out, another new map was added! Cool! I check to see what it is, and turns out, it is one of the ones they leaked a former HnG streamer that I watch 2 years ago. WOW, I have no words anymore for this game. RETO, if you want to bring back former players and veterans while at the same time hooking in new players, PLEASE! Take a look at what made so many players come in and play mid 2016-17 and rework from there because at this rate, the game WILL die.TL;DR Game was good back in the past, never should have left Beta phase. New players beware, veterans/ returning veterans, either join me and watch the game we loved die or help tell RETO that what they are doing is wrong/ plz roll back to the pre Squad 2.0 era.PS: I have nothing against Squad 2.0, I thought it was a decent idea but I am using it as a point of referance if you will.Sincerely. A veteran player that has lost hope
Early Access ReviewMy favorite free to play FPS alongside Warface. Doesn't take a whole lot to run and I can play it on my potato i3 laptop with minimal lag. Balanced guns and gunplay that you won't find on nearly any other free to play FPS. Overall amazing game.EDIT:As of 1 September, 2018, this game has gone down the drain. They recently released a new map and 2 guns (which are poop). The map is only a TDM map, so that tells you something. The fact that it took a whole year for them to add another map other than Sabotage really says something about the devs. "So where has all the money we spent on boxes and keys gone" You may ask?Well I'll tell you what it HASN'T gone towards:1) A working anti-cheat2) Better Maps3) Better servers4) Worthwhile improvements to the base system of the gameMan, this game had so much potential. I loved it for the short time I played it when it first came out and then when I came back to it, but its flaws outshine it's strengths.Back to CS:GO. At least there the cheaters can get reported.
Early Access ReviewI may not have played this game much since the new update. but what I can say, is this: Robocraft used to a fun, unique game with team based gamemodes, with rewards based on how well you did. which allowed you to progress in the way you wanted. You  could build what you wanted and the bot still work semi-well.now. You get crates. which give you crap. even the best of crates will give you basic loot. which they claim is "uncommon" which is nothing more than the most basic weapons, the old Tier 1 items from when the game had tiers.There is no real progression you just hope you get what you want.There are an assortment of hacks out there for the game which ruins the fun for everyone else, because they can't play. Roboshield does nothing.  
Early Access ReviewAnyone with an IQ of 5 or higher can see that this is a bad attempt at a cash grab for an financial hole they dug themselves in with the Korean, Japanese and Russian version. Don't even bother, we failed bois, go back.
1) Download2) If you have money, pay to win- Money can buy Legendary cards- Legendary cards can r@pe the opponent @ss- There is a limit of 1 Legendary card type per deck- But there is no limit for different Legendary cards per deck3) Rage uninstall If you don't agree whit p2w in a f2p game
â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it,I played an assult mission for 47 minuts and after  i rate the battle there was no results and i got nothing not a single credit.This has happend several times and i would like if they could fix it or give some reason why this happend.
1. Started to play game 2.got in server for beginners got killed in 2 min from spawn 3.Made a new character 4. joined another server for beginners 5. got killed again in less than 2 min.
Early Access ReviewAutoinstalls Gaijin and starts seeding. Do not install.Edit: I was going to remove my review since they made Gaijin optional, then I saw a developer saying this:"Gaijin net agent is completely harmless and useful software, and not using it can lead to delays in updates, if Steam updates are switched off/or not effecient."I fail to see why Steam updates would be switched off or would be inefficient. There are plenty of developers on Steam right now that don't use third party software to update their games. Whether you're referring to players disabling Steam auto update or you guys disabling Steam updates for the game yourselves, it really doesn't matter. Players that disable auto update do it for a reason, so you really can't call that inefficient. If you guys disable Steam updates for the game, then it better be for troubleshooting purposes. Other than that, the only reason I can see why you guys would do that is to encourage players to continue to use Gaijin by creating a problem that doesn't exist.One of the biggest issues with Gaijin is that some players have bandwidth limits, and when Gaijin is secretly seeding the game it uses up their bandwidth. It is literally stealing other people's data to save money. To these players who are spending money to update your game, it isn't harmless.
I've played this game a fair amount on my phone and move between the steam and mobile version, I love the game but my only problem is how long it takes to find a game; For basically all lobbies despite having several hundered "ACTIVE" players, I end up waiting upwards to half an hour to find a game. the only quick games finds I've had was in 1 of the club rooms. Otherwise I'm just sitting here waiting for an opponent.Additional notes about my account if it's a matchmaking issue, I'm still a fairly new player, I don't have many of the towers unlocked and don't have any tier 3 towers at all yet. I'd likely have most of the towers and upgrades unlocked if I was able to find games quicker but that never seems to happen.Also the time I've spent waiting has mostly been on my phone so my time on steam doesn't reflect the time I've actually spent waiting on games.This game in my eyes is a great and enjoyable game, but the fact that I have to wait an extremely long time to find a game is the only reason I don't recommend the game.
This game is full of people cheating, by the time the server notices this they already have all your stuff.It's forced PVP no matter what essentially PVPVZ.Game should have a PVZ selection also so that some poeple can enjoy their time online
Early Access Review3rd time is not the harm for bless.  Dungeons are a joke, no end game what so ever, i was evpecting some problems being an early acess title but they have literally fixed NOTHING from the previous fails and actually made the game worse.  DO NOT BUY IT IS A MONEY GRAB!!!!!
I Downloaded this game to check out the VR mode, the firt thing i was met by was a really choppy menu system, the controllers are buggy and jumps back and forth. After using my mouse instead i managed to press the campain button, and the game stopped working in the loading screen. Restarted it and tried intant action mode, same there. So basically i couldn't even start the game 
Early Access ReviewJust got my refund with 21h in, reached level 40. Game is broken beyond redemption!!!Ã¯Â»Â¿I'm not just talking about the catastrophic launch but almost everything else:The game is still broken beyond redemption after all these years. I'm not just talking about the catastrophic launch but almost everything else:Bad, static combat that constantly locks you in place. Questionable character progression and balance. I don't want to know how terrible the endgame balance is going to be since it's pretty obvious non of these combat changes were tested. As zerk you can play the entire game with one combo and there is no reason to ever press something else if you don't need some sort of utility. The horrible camera and UI are a joke and the auction house is so bad I don't have words. Ah and it lost a bunch of my auctions and gold due to the server crashes.I don't trust the dev to fix this game. I mean this is the third release and it is still a huge garbage fire. Dont buy, stay away!
Early Access Reviewâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dissapointed, after defending the game for so long they finally release it with the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ optimisation(they said it would be better), translation from Google translate(maybe even worse) and with all end-game content missing(this was advertised in their steam page).STAY AWAY FROM EASTERN MMORPGS
Its not a bad game if it wasnt for the in your face pay2win like a coin operated cabinet. The game does nothing beyond showing you how to pay but not play. Players/bots are just there camping, waiting at all times. The only cool part I enjoyed was the night time fighting with muzzle flash during combat. thats itin summary it is like dayz, its more stable and has less dynamic weather, more weapons thought. and you can jump, very oddly in place. It plays like a console game and looks like a 360 game. It is definetely fun with friends who have money, prob not for kids as there is text/voice chat.
A ridiculous game that prizes itself on completely unbalanced teams. There seems to be no discrimination towards experience and vehicle strength. Example, I've seen one player slug six shells into an opponent only for the oppenent to turn around and one shot them. So naturally a complete noob like myself would just be toyed with on EVERY battle field. There are steep learning curves and then there is just utter insult to injury. Just another clear example of how FTP is just PTW.
Early Access ReviewThis is a game made by Gaijin. A Russian company that is notorious for shady practices by consumers and partners alike. Do not trust Gaijin. Do not give Gaijin money.Edit: Be sure to follow the thread and watch as a shill for the concerned parties tries to defend Gaijin. High comedy indeed.
The game is full of cheaters. I am a decent board game player and I tried to bear it, but a player starting with 10 million chips when you are supposed to start with two? It's obviously hacked. And too many times I see coalition between players when it's free for all. One player buying his friend's property when the game's just started so that you can push your chips to one player. It's cancer and there is no way anyone with a sense of decency can play this game. Be warned that this game is full of cheaters and there is absolutely no penalty against cheating.
I don't like this game, but it's mostly for personal reasons.I just had a match with incredibly toxic players, and got falsely reported several times, so I'm uninstalling. The MOBA itself is different, sure, but the matchamking seems rather unfair. Perhaps not as bad as Dota 2, but still rather unenjoyable. Give the game a try, but... tread carefully.
Couldn't play on PC (Windows 10). Whenever I hold acceleration button turning left/right doesn't work. Have to release acceleration in order to turn. Is it supposed to work like that?
Early Access Reviewestimated time to go prone: 9 minutesestimated time to get a vehicle: lol pay moneyestimated time to get that sniper rifle you wanted: lol dedicate your entire life playing this game
Free to play....but pay money if you want to win online matches. The online mode unevenly ranks you into matches with people who have been playing for at least 2 years or more or just people who have paid money to have better cards. The only thing worth doing for free in this game is the story mode, and then uninstalling.
hate the update7.00 is worse than the previous version. The bot is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stupid they keep taking the courier all over the world and im fed up with this game now probably not gonna play this game anymoreAND PLEASE DO NOT FORGET TO NERF THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING APE KING
trying to login to Facebook but it does not worki am trying to log in to my Facebook account that has better stuff than Starter crap                                                               How can i fix it?
On mobile this game seems good, but on PC it doesn't fit; the game requires you to pick it up multiple times a day and only needs your attention for short periods of time, so I found myself easily bored.One thing I give this game credit for is how much it made me laugh in the short time I played it.  To gain additional vault dwellers you either accept outsiders or mate your existing inhabitants.  There was 1 man, of whom become known as Stud McQueen, whos designated post was the living quarters (aka the insemination chamber).  This sexual beast of a man became the father of every child born in the vault.  Unfortunately, the children all came to term at the same time when I checked up on them last evening and panic ensued.  Six babies were delivered with no medical assistance onto the living room carpet, those stains will never come out.  The resulting population boom saw a period of shortages of food and water, the vault's inhabitants began to suffer.... everyone except Stud McQueen, who was perpetually at 100% happiness... the cvnt..........   One mother even came to term in the chaos, however there were no more beds to house her baby as the overseer didn't pick up enough bottle caps from his mate's stag do last week to construct a new birthing pit and hovel combo for said mother;  she just had to hold it in...  the baby is now a grown man and has even landed a job, he works from home, of course, concidering the mother needs to be wheeled to the power plant everyday and her umbillical cord doesn't streatch that far.In short, the game is designed to be used on mobile devices, maybe you can play it on PC while on facebook or doing some typing, that way you can check up on the game every now and then as you need to wait real time untill you can interact with it again.
Well, since I wrote my review they have added ridiculous amounts of garbage to the game. They definitely have brainstorming sessions for how to come up with new items and even categories of items to add to the game. this way they can sell you a new card tab, and an essence tab, etc.They have lost sight of what made the game good. It went from a game with the best loot to one of the worst. 99% of items that drop are now garbage. It is bad enough that they expect people to buy more and more tabs to deal with their hyper inflation of item types and categories, but they don't even care that we also have to sort all this junk.Do they realize that they are making the game tedious? Even if I was filthy rich, and I could buy 10,000 tabs, why would I want to sort that many items?!?! This utter disrespect for the time of their customers, just so they can make as much money as possible, has earned them this negative review.Strawberry fields forever... because: greed.original review several years ago: the true diablo 2, because it understood the best part of diablo 2: how to make the powerful armor/weapons feel distinct and their effectiveness and useability unique and not just different numerical values. amazing game, until you reach end game. then you start to see how the free to play model does actually influence gameplay design and how the player is expected to become a gambler and hoarder to continue enjoying the game (inventory space = $$). however, the game is free and the skill system gives you hundreds (thousands?) of hours of nerd or-ga-sm-ic (don't censor this volvo, because that makes it unintelligible) experimentation with new characters, so i must recommend it.
Oh man. Oh man, oh man. Not again.jkdrake is fake pls no hateAnyways, this game was my favorite game for a solid week, the blocky art style, the rpg feel, the reminiscence of cartoons, oh dear god this game was near â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥IC when I first played it. Then came the devs with the updates. I was like; 'ok, ill just wait for a bit then i can play with my friends in a bit'. The updates continued to rain upon me, so I couldn't actually play the game. Then, when I was finally able to play the game once more, I was presented into the main hub with a lot of offers to buy things, and quite frankly it had become a pay-to-win game by the end of 2015. A sight in which was very dissapointing, let alone my high hopes for a great rpg game, as I struggle to get into RPG games. Oh Trove, how you dissapoint me so.
Early Access ReviewThe devs are trying too hard to please everyone.At the time of this review, an update removed a set way to get legendary class weapon by first getting a kill and then crafting said weapon. How do you get them now? Well by sheer luck of course. Any chest has a chance to drop a class weapon, which means you can get one 30 seconds into a match or never.This made me quit the game because i dont like rng based gameplay.Hopefully something is done about this, until then, goodbye.
The only thing this game has going for it is the fan service, and even at that it kind of fails.  It isn't even a good clicker game.  The upgrades are boring and uninspired.  The enemy girls you click to defeat are too repetitive.  The character on the right that I suppose is supposed to be you just stands there completely useless and devoid of any life or charm.  Perhaps the worse offender of this poor excuse for a clicker activity is the UI.  It's awful.  There's nothing here except the ability to pay money to dress up a paper doll.  At least with an actual paper doll you could do something interetesting with.  You can't even wipe yourâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥with this game.  I have an irrational adoration of clicker games and even I can't find anything worthwhile about this one.
